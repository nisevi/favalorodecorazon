                <h3>Childhood & Early Life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rene Favaloro was born on July 14, 1923, in La Plata, the capital city in the Province of Buenos
                        Aires. His father was Juan B. Favaloro, a carpenter, and his mother was Ida Y Raffaelli, a
                        dressmaker. He had a brother, who also became a surgeon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From an early age Favaloro had a passion for football, though he never considered making a
                        career out of it. It was an uncle who was a physician who inspired the boy to become a doctor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1941 he received his bachelor’s degree from Rafael Hernández National College, after which he
                        joined the Argentine Army, to serve during the World War II. After being discharged as a
                        Lieutenant in 1945, he started his medical studies at the University of La Plata. He received
                        his degree in 1949, following which he went to Polyclinical Hospital in La Plata to serve an
                        internship.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Career:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rene Favaloro had to move to Jacinto Arauz, a poor village situated around 300 miles away from
                        La Plata, to take the place of a country surgeon who had fallen ill. Soon he became interested
                        in developments in cardiovascular intervention and also developed an interest in thoracic
                        surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti who suggested to him to go to Cleveland
                        Clinic in the United States. Since Favaloro was working in a rural area, he initially hesitated,
                        but later realized that upon his return from the United States, he would be able to contribute
                        much more to his country and community. Thus he went to the US.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At Cleveland Clinic, he served as apprentice to Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, who was also the
                        co-chairperson of the center. He also studied with Mason Sones, who is considered the father of
                        coronary cineangiography.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1967, Rene Favaloro performed heart bypass operation on a 51-year-old woman. Though two other
                        surgeons, Dr. David Sabiston and Dr. Garrett, had performed heart bypass surgeries earlier,
                        neither of the operations had been reported in a medical journal. Thus Favaloro’s surgery became
                        the first planned heart bypass operation to be reported.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Favaloro’s technique involved first stopping the heart and then taking a section of vein from
                        the leg of the patient. After that, one end was sewed into the aorta while the other end was
                        attached to the blocked artery. This technique, which was the fundamental work of Favaloro’s
                        career, became quite famous, and within a year 171 surgeries were performed at the Cleveland
                        Clinic alone. Later, it became a standard procedure for heart bypass surgeries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1971, he gave up his career in Cleveland Clinic and returned to Argentina as he had always
                        wanted to serve the people of his country. He soon realized the importance of having an
                        institution of similar excellence to Cleveland Clinic and began collecting funds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1975, he established the famous Favaloro Foundation with the support of the Cleveland Clinic.
                        He not only trained doctors from all over Argentina as well as the Americas, but also conducted
                        several courses, seminars and conferences, to improve the level of standard of his institution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ‘Basic Investigation Laboratory’ was established by him in 1980, which was financed with his
                        own money. Later, in 1992, the ‘Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology’ was also opened in
                        Buenos Aires. It started providing highly specialized services in the fields of cardiology,
                        cardiovascular surgery, as well as heart, lung, and bone marrow transplants along with many
                        other areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rene Favaloro operated on the famous businessman cum boxing promoter Tito Lectoure in 1990. He
                        also performed numerous bypass surgeries on poor and needy patients for free, though the costs
                        were extremely high. He felt that for him, it was a moral obligation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He strongly emphasized on the prevention of diseases and spread awareness on how following basic
                        rules of hygiene would help in reducing diseases as well as the mortality rate. His institution,
                        to fulfill his objective, used to have illness detection and prevention programs. Because of
                        their skilled professionals, specialized technology, and medical ethics, the Favaloro Foundation
                        still stands as one of the largest institutes for cardiology all over the Americas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Major Works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rene Favaloro wrote several books during his career. ‘Surgical Treatment of Coronary
                        Arteriosclerosis’ can be regarded as one of his most famous works. This book focuses on his
                        famous technique which he had invented for heart bypass surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Memories of a Rural Doctor' was another one of his well-known works. In it, he mainly discusses
                        his career while working in the village Jacinto Arauz, and the sad life of the people there, and
                        how he worked hard to improve their lifestyle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Personal Life & Legacy:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In 1951 Rene Favaloro married Maria Antonia Delgado, with whom he had a relationship since they
                        were in high school. They shared a happy and peaceful life. However, they didn’t have any
                        children.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Favaloro was quite frustrated at the state of the world. He realized that though his interest
                        was only in curing people and creating a better world, he still didn’t receive the necessary
                        support or funds from the governmental agencies for this noble endeavor. Disillusioned and sad,
                        he shot himself dead at his home in Buenos Aires on July 29, 2000. The whole country was
                        aggrieved at his death. Though his death was tragic, his life had taught humanity a lesson in
                        selfless service.

                <i>"The death of René Gerónimo Favaloro on 29 July 2000, at the age of 77, leaves a void in the field of
                    cardiovascular surgery: we have lost one of our most respected and significant contributors.
                    Although he was always hesitant to carry the moniker of “father” of coronary artery bypass surgery,
                    he is the surgeon we should credit with introducing coronary bypass surgery into the clinical arena.
                    Indeed, Dr. Favaloro's pioneering contributions to cardiovascular surgery will be an enduring legacy
                    to his homeland of Argentina and to humanity." - Denton A. Cooley, MD | Texas Heart Institute
